 ‚ùå Before 
<img src="logo.png">

**Pro tip:** Alt text should describe the image's purpose, not just its appearance.

### 2. Empty Links

**What it means:** Links have no text content.

**How to fix:**

### 4. Low Heading Hierarchy

## Tips for Best Results

- **Re-scan after fixes** - Verify your improvements worked
- **Save your results** - Take screenshots or copy the recommendations
- **Share with your team** - Forward the URL or export results

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- **Don't scan localhost URLs** - The tool can only access public websites
- **Don't scan password-protected pages** - We can't access content behind logins
- **Don't ignore moderate issues** - They still affect user experience
- **Don't fix blindly** - Understand why each issue matters

## What Gets Checked?

Our tool currently scans for **6 core accessibility issues**:

| Check | What It Does | WCAG Guideline |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Alt Text | Finds images without alternative text | 1.1.1 (Level A) |
| Link Text | Identifies empty or meaningless links | 2.4.4 (Level A) |
| Form Labels | Detects unlabeled form inputs | 3.3.2 (Level A) |
| Headings | Checks for proper heading structure | 2.4.6 (Level AA) |
| Page Title | Verifies page has a descriptive title | 2.4.2 (Level A) |
| Language | Ensures HTML lang attribute is present | 3.1.1 (Level A) |

**Note:** This is an automated scan. Manual testing is still recommended for complete WCAG compliance.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How accurate is the scan?

**A:** The scanner has a ~95% success rate for the checks it performs. However, it only covers basic automated checks. For full WCAG 2.1 compliance, you'll need manual testing as well.

---

### Q: Does it work on mobile sites?

**A:** Yes! The scanner fetches and analyzes the HTML regardless of whether it's a mobile or desktop site. However, it doesn't test mobile-specific interactions.

---

### Q: Can I scan password-protected pages?

**A:** No, the scanner can only access publicly available pages. You'll need to scan the public portions of your site or temporarily make pages public for scanning.

---

### Q: Why did my scan fail?

**Common reasons:**
- Website is down or slow to respond (timeout after 15 seconds)
- Website blocks automated requests
- Invalid URL or domain doesn't exist
- Too many redirects (max 5 allowed)

**Solutions:**
- Try again in a few minutes
- Check the URL is correct
- Try a different page on the same site

---

### Q: Can I export the results?

**A:** Currently, you can copy/paste or screenshot the results. Export to PDF/CSV is coming soon!

---

### Q: How often should I scan my site?

**Recommendations:**
- After any content updates
- Before major releases
- Monthly for active sites
- Weekly for frequently updated sites

---

### Q: Is my website data stored?

**A:** No, we don't store your scan results. Each scan is processed in real-time and results are only shown to you.

---

### Q: Does this guarantee WCAG compliance?

**A:** No. Automated scans can only catch about 30-40% of accessibility issues. For full WCAG compliance, you'll need:
- Manual testing with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast analysis
- User testing with people with disabilities

Our tool is a great starting point, but not a complete solution.

---

## What to Do After Your Scan

### 1. Prioritize Issues
Start with **Critical** issues, then move to **Serious**, then **Moderate**.

### 2. Fix Issues on Your Site
Use the "How to Fix" guidance provided for each issue.

### 3. Test Your Fixes
- Use a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
- Navigate with keyboard only (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
- Check color contrast with browser tools

### 4. Re-scan
Run the scan again to verify issues are resolved.

### 5. Keep Improving
Accessibility is ongoing! Re-scan regularly as you add new content.
