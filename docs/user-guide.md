3. **Test during development** - Catch issues early
4. **Scan regularly** - After major updates or redesigns

### After Scanning
1. **Prioritize critical issues** - Fix red flags first
2. **Test your fixes** - Scan again to verify
3. **Document improvements** - Track your progress
4. **Educate your team** - Share results with developers and designers

### General Tips
- **Don't rely solely on automated tools** - Manual testing is important

## FAQ

### How accurate are the results?

The tool checks for 6 common WCAG Level A issues with ~95% accuracy. However:
- Some issues require manual testing (e.g., color contrast, keyboard navigation)
- AI suggestions are helpful but should be reviewed by developers
- Complex accessibility issues may not be detected

### What does the tool NOT check?

Currently, the tool does NOT check:
- Color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus indicators
- ARIA attribute validity
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Video captions or audio transcripts
- Complex interactive widgets

### Can I scan password-protected pages?

No, the tool can only scan publicly accessible URLs. For authenticated pages, you'll need to:
- Make a temporary public version for testing, or
- Use browser extensions for manual testing

### Why did my scan fail?

Common reasons for failed scans:
- **Connection timeout** - Site took longer than 15 seconds to respond
- **DNS error** - Domain doesn't exist or is unreachable
- **Too many redirects** - More than 5 redirects detected
- **Bot protection** - Site is blocking automated requests
- **Not HTML** - URL points to PDF, image, or other non-HTML content

### How often should I scan my website?

Recommended scanning frequency:
- **During development** - Before launching new features
- **After major updates** - When redesigning or adding content
- **Monthly** - For actively maintained sites
- **Quarterly** - For stable, low-traffic sites

### Is my data stored or shared?

No. The tool:
- Does NOT store scan results
- Does NOT share URLs with third parties
- Does NOT track individual users
- Processes everything server-side and discards after response

### Can I export or save results?

Not currently, but we're working on:
- PDF report generation
- CSV export for spreadsheets
- Scan history for logged-in users
- Scheduled automated scans

### Do you have an API?

Not yet, but an API is planned for future release. It will allow:
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing workflows
- Batch scanning of multiple URLs
- Custom reporting and analytics

### How can I learn more about accessibility?

Great resources:
- [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) - Comprehensive accessibility guides
- [W3C WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) - Official WCAG documentation
- [A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) - Community-driven checklist
